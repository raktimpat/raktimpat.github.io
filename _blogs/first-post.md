## The Rise of the Transformer

The world of AI was forever changed with the 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need". This paper introduced the **Transformer architecture**, which has become the foundation for most state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT and GPT.

### Key Components

1.  **Self-Attention**: Allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence.
2.  **Positional Encodings**: Since the model doesn't process words sequentially, this injects information about the word's position.

Here is a small Python code snippet:

```python
def self_attention(query, key, value):
    # Simplified attention mechanism
    scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1))
    attention_weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, value)
    return output
